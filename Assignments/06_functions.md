# Practice to use math library functions
    Show the value of x after each of the following statements is performed:
        i. x = floor(7.5)
        ii. x = ceil (0.0)
        iii. x = ceil (-6.4)
        iv. x = log10(100.0)
        v. x = ceil (floor (-5.5))

# Practice to write a simple function
    Write a function called circleArea() that take the radius of a circle as an argument and calculate and return the area. In the main program read the radius value from the user, call circleArea() and display the result.

# Practice to write functions and use those functions to solve a problem
    Write three functions do the following 
        add - add two integers pass as parameters and return the result
        multiply - multiply two integers pass as parameters and return the result 
        square â€“ receive an integer as a parameter and return the result after multiplying the number by itself. 

    Use these functions in the main program to calculate the result of the following mathematical expression. 
        (3*4 + 5*7)^2

# Additional exercises
    1. Write a C program to adding two numbers according to the user input. You should declare a separate function called "addition ()" to add two given user inputs. 
    2. Write functions to compute the surface area and volume of a cube for a given length of a side.
    3. Write a simple T20 cricket prediction program as follows. When you are given the current run rate(runs per over) and number of overs played, predict the projected score for current run rate and higher run rates of whole inning.(e.g. Current RR: 6.4 per over, Higher RR: 7 per over, 8 per over, 9 per over).
    4. Write a C function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given numbers.
    5. Write a function in C to sum the powers 2n of all integers n between two given numbers a and b.
        Sample output: E.g: If a = 5 and b = 8 Then sum = 52 + 62 + 72 + 82
    6. Write a recursive C function to get the following output regarding factorial.
        Factorial of 1: 1
        Factorial of 2: 2
        Factorial of 3: 6
        Factorial of 4: 24
        Factorial of 5: 120
        Factorial of 6: 720
        Factorial of 7: 5040
        Factorial of 8: 40320
        Factorial of 9: 362880
        Factorial of 10: 3628800
