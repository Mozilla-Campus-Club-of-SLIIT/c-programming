# Practice how to use variables in printf statement
    what does the following print? Assume x = 2 and y = 3

    1. printf(“*\n**\n***\n****\n*****\n”);
    2. printf( “%d”, x + x );
    3. printf( “x = “);
    4. printf( “x=%d”, x);
    5. printf( “%d = %d”, x+y, y+x);
    6. /* printf( “%d”, x+y ); */
    7. printf(“\n”);
    8. float z = 45.567; printf(“value is %.2f”, z);


# Practice number formatting
    a) What is the output of the following statements?
        i. printf( “%.2f\n”, 3.446);
        ii. printf(“%.1f\n”, 3.446);

    b) Write statement to,
        i. Print the value 123.4567 with 2 digit precision.
        ii. Print the value 3.14159 with three digits to the right of the decimal point.
        iii. Print the value 333.546372 in a field of width 15 characters with precision of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

# Practice scanf statement in a C program
    i. Write a C program to input two marks from the keyboard and display the marks.
    ii. Modify the above program to calculate the total of the marks and display the total.
    iii. Next, add a statement to calculate the average mark.
    iv. Display the average.

# Practice using structures in C program
    Writa a C program to do the following.
        a) Create a structure called item to store the following details of items in a shop.
            itemNo      integer
            price       double
            quantity    integer

        b) Create 2 variables from the item data type and store the following data entered through the keyboard. Print the detail on the screen in the following format.
            itemNo      Price       Quantity
            1           10.00       12
            2           15.00       4

# Optional exercises
    1. Write a C program to print the following characters in a reverse way.
        Test characters: 'X', 'M', 'L'
        Expected output: The reverse of XML is LMX.
        (hint: use 3 character variables)
    
    2. Write a C program to accept two integers from user the user and calculate the sum of the two integers.
        Sample output:
            Input the first integer: 20
            Input the second integer: 10
            Sum of the two integers: 30
