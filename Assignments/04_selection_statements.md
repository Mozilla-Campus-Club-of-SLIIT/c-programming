# Practice to write an if statement
    Write a C program to input an integer from the keyboard and convert the number into a positive number, if the user input is a negative value.
        Sample output:
            Enter the number: 5
            Output: 5

            Enter the number: -2
            Output: 2

        (Hint : if x is negative , -x is positive)

# Practice to write if… else statement
    Assume that you are supposed to write a C program to update the bank balance of a customer based on the transactions performed (withdrawals/ deposits) by the customer.
    
    Implement the program by following the given steps.
    
    i. Prompt the user to input transaction type (Withdrawal/ Deposit)
    ii. Read the user input from the keyboard using getchar( ) function (w – withdrawals, d –deposits) 
    iii. If the user input 'w' or 'W', display message "You have selected to withdraw money". If the user input 'd' or 'D', display message "You have selected to deposit money". Otherwise display an error message "You have selected an invalid transaction type" and terminate the program.
    iv. Modify the above program to input the bank balance and the amount.
    v. Based on the selected transaction type (withdrawal or deposit), display the new balance.

# Practice to write an if…else statement
    Write a C program to create a simple calculator. The program should allow the user to enter two numbers and an operator. The operators are
        1. +
        2. -
        3. *
        4. /
    
    You should print an appropriate error message if the user enters invalid operator. Use nested if-else statements in your program.

# Practice to write a switch statement
    Rewrite the calculator program using a switch statement.

# Optional exercises
    1. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.
    2. Write a C program to calculate the revenue from a sale based on the unit price and quantity of a product input by the user. 
    
        The discount rate is 15% for the quantity purchased between 120 and 160 units, and 20% for the quantity purchased greater than 160 units. If the quantity purchased is less than 120 units, the discount rate is 0%.

    3. Write a C program to check whether a character is an alphabet, digit or special character.
    4. Body constitution is measured using BMI (Body Mass Index) which depends only on the height and weight of a person. It can be defined by,
        BMI = weight / (height * height)
        Where weight is taken in kilograms and height in meters. Four general grades are proposed such that,
            Underweight : BMI < 18.5
            Normal weight : 18.5 <= BMI < 25.0
        
        Write a C program to output user’s body constitution grade when he/she inputs body weight (kg) and the height (m).
    5. Write a C program to find whether a given year is a leap year or not.
    6. Write a C program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.
        Sample output:
            Enter your age: 18
            Output: Oh! You can't vote. 

            Enter your age: 25
            Output: Congratuations! You are eligible for casting your vote.
    7. Write a C program to find the largest of three numbers.
        Sample output:
            Enter number1: 12
            Enter number2: 43
            Enter number3: 20
            Ouput: The 2nd number is the largest number.
