# Practice to write while loops
    i. Write a C program from 10 to 20
    ii. Prompt the user to enter series of numbers from the keyboard and display the numbers. If user enters a negative number stop reading the numbers.
    iii. Modify the program written in ii) above display the sum and average of the positive numbers entered.

# Compare while and do while loop
    What do the following two code segments will print for the cases x = 1 and x= 10?
    
    while(x > 1){
        printf("%d", x);
        x--;
    }

    do{
        printf("%d", x);
        x--;
    }while(x > 1);

# Practice to use loops (Use while loop)
    i. Write a C program to enter 4 module marks of a student from the keyboard and display the total of all four module marks.
    ii. Modify the program written in i) above to enter 4 module marks of 3 students and display their total marks.
    iii. Display the student with the highest total mark.

    2. Find the maximum consecutive 1's in a string of 0's and 1's.
        Eg: 00110001001110 - Output :3 [Max number of consecutive 1's is 3]

    3. Write a method to count the number of 2s in given range of integers.
        Sample output:
            Input start number: 10
            Input end number: 20
            Print range: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
            Total number of 2s: 2

    4.  Write a program in C to convert a binary number into a decimal number.
        Sample output:
            Input binary number: 1010
            Decimal value: 10
