# Revise input and output statement in C
    Write a C program to enter the radius of a circle and display the diameter, the circumference and the area.

# Practice arithmetic operations in C
    Write a C program that input one five digit number, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another.
        Sample output:
            Enter the five digit number: 42139
            Output: 4 2 1 3 9

# Practice relational and logical operators in C
    Assume i = 1, j = 2, k = 3 and m = 2. What does each of the following statements print?
        i. printf( "%d", i == 1 );
        ii. printf( "%d", j == 3 );
        iii. printf( "%d", i >= 1 && j < 4 );
        iv. printf( "%d", k + m < j || 3 – j >= k );
        v. printf( "%d", !m );
        vi. printf( "%d", !( j – m ) );

# Optional exercises
    1. If a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4 get the answers for the following equations using your C programming knowledge. 
    (Note: The answers should be in 2 decimal points.)
        i. ( a + b ) / ( c + d )
        ii. a + b / ( c + d )
        iii. (a + b ) / c + d
        iv. a * b / c * d

    2. If a = 1, write a C program to do the following evaluations;
        i. a
        ii. a++
        iii. ++a
        iv. a--
        v. --a

    3. If the following declarations and assignments are made,
        char C = 'B';
        int i = 3, j = 3, k = 3;
        double x = 0.0, y = 2.3; 

        Evaluate the following expressions.
            a. i && j && k 
            b. x || i && j - 3 
            c. i < j && x < y 
            d. i < j || x < y
            e. 'A' <= C && C <= 'Z' 
            f. C - 1 == 'A' || C + 1 == 'Z'
    
    4. Calculate the area of a disk which has a radius of 5.4 using the formula, 3.14 * r * r.

    5. Calculate the surface area of the following disk with the outer radius 7 and the inner radius 5.
    
    6. Calculate the volume of a cylinder which has a base radius of 3.2 and a height of 10.1.

    7. Fahrenheit to Celsius temperature conversion can be done using the formula,
        F = C * 9/5 + 32
        Write a C program to calculate the Fahrenheit temperature for a given temperature in Celsius.
