# Practice to store and print data in an array
    i. Write a C program that reads marks of 10 students in to a single subscripted array.
    ii. Above marks should be between 0 to 20. Modify the above program to add marks to the array only if the input mark is between the given range.
    iii. Display the values stored in the array.

# Practice to access data stored in an array
    Modify the above program to find the mean of the marks stored in the array.

# Practice to manipulate data in arrays
    Write a C program to create an integer array called Motion of size 5. Ask the user to enter values to the array from the keyboard. Rotate the values of the array by one position in the forward direction and display the values. 

        Ex: number in index 4 should move to index 3, Number in index 3 should move to index2, number index 0 should move to index 4.

        Initial value: 10 6 8 2 9
        After rotating: 6 8 2 9 10

# Practice to manipulate data in arrays
    Write a C program that read numbers from an integer array and graph the information in the form of bar chat. Sample output is given below.

    Element     Value       Histogram
    0           19          *******************
    1           3           ***
    2           15          ***************
    3           7           *******
    4           11          ***********
    5           9           *********
    6           13          *************
    7           5           *****

# Practice to manipulate character arrays
    A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward and forward. Write a C program that enter a word, store it in an array and determine whether it is palindrome or not.

    Sample output:
        Enter the word: CIVIC
        Output: CIVIC is palindrome.

        Enter the word: CAR
        Output: CAR is not a palindrome.

# Practice to manipulate 2D arrays
    Write C program that to add following two matrixes and display output.

    5 7 8 9     2 2 1 3     7  9  9 13
    9 3 0 6     8 1 3 1     17 4  3  7          
    8 1 9 2  +  1 2 2 4  =   9 3 11  6
    4 7 2 1     3 1 1 2      7 8  3  3

# Practice to manipulate 2D arrays
    Use a double-subscripted array to solve the following problem. A company has four salespeople ( 1 to 4) who sell five different products ( 1 to 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product sold. Each slip contains:

        a) The salesperson number
        b) The product number
        c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day

    Assume that the information from all the slips for a day is available. Write a program that will read all this information for the day and store in a double-subscripted array sales. For each product find and display the total sales.

# Additional exercises
    1. Create a multiplication table storing the values in a 2D array and then print the table.
 
             1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
         1   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
         2   2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18  20  
         3   3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27  30
         4   4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36  40
         5   5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45  50
         6   6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54  60
         7   7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63  70
         8   8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72  80

        10  10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
    
    2. Using the above two matrixes write functions for matrixes addition, subtraction and multiplication.

        3 5 7       6 0 2 
        1 6 5       4 7 1
        4 9 8       7 2 1

    3. Declare an array to store 15 double numbers given below.

        34.5, 56.7, 12.6, 98.4, 54.21, 89.55, 54.2, 98.4, 73.2, 21.45, 34.5, 98.4, 21.45, 98.4, 9.3

        Write separate functions in the C program to perform following operations.

        a. Calculate the total of the elements in the array and then return the total.
        b. Calculate the average of the elements in the array and then return the average. 
        c. Find the minimum element in the array and return.
        d. Find the maximum elements in the array and return.
